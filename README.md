# Dodge-The-Creeps
Godot Tutorial Result

## Summary

A basic 2d game in Godot. This is the result of following the [Your First 2d Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) tutorial from the Godot docs.

# Reflection

This project was my introduction to Godot. I wanted to get a sense of how Godot worked before I commited tousing it as a platform to continue my learning, so I figured I'd just do a short tutorial. After finishing this tutorial im still not sure whether I'll use Godot in the future for game dev. There is obviously a huge amount to learn to work with this software, but so far I was not super impressed with it. I'm not yet sure if this is a Godot thing, or maybe all video game engines are like this. I may try Unity next to see if I like that more, but I assume it's going to be quite similar to Godot. Not much else to report on this one.

## In this Project, I practiced:
  - Game dev
  - Event Handling
  - Observer Pattern
